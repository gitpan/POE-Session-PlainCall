POE-Session-PlainCall version 0.0100
===========================

POE::Session::PlainCall makes @_ work like everyone expects. It
allows you to create POE sessions with event handlers that are
called as plain perl functions and methods are called, unlike
POE::Session, which populates @_ to its suiting.

It is still compatible with the rest of POE.
